# Computer Vision Project - Sign For Help (Group 14)
Our computer vision project aims to develop a model capable of detecting and recognizing the [Signal for Help (SFH)](https://canadianwomen.org/signal-for-help/) hand gestureâ€“a universal distress signal used by individuals experiencing violence or abuse. The problem we are addressing is the lack of accessible and automated tools that can identify this silent call for help, which could support early intervention and improve personal safety.

This is an important issue because many victims cannot ask for help out loud (e.g., the abuser is nearby), and this automatic gesture recognition could enable faster responses and potentially save lives. Our model could be used in real life to detect SFH through smartphone cameras, wearable devices, telehealth sessions, or public service kiosks, enabling faster intervention and support for individuals experiencing abuse.
