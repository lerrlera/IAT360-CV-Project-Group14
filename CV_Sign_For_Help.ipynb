        "###Group 14\n",
        "Our computer vision project aims to develop a model capable of detecting and recognizing the [Signal for Help (SFH)](https://canadianwomen.org/signal-for-help/) hand gesture–a universal distress signal used by individuals experiencing violence or abuse. The problem we are addressing is the lack of accessible and automated tools that can identify this silent call for help, which could support early intervention and improve personal safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an important issue because many victims cannot ask for help out loud (e.g., the abuser is nearby), and this automatic gesture recognition could enable faster responses and potentially save lives. Our model could be used in real life to detect SFH through smartphone cameras, wearable devices, telehealth sessions, or public service kiosks, enabling faster intervention and support for individuals experiencing abuse.\n"

        "These images were sourced from 2 existing datasets and organized into 2 class folders, ‘open_hand’ and ‘closed_hand’ for a classification task. Specifically, we used images labelled ‘B’ from the ASL dataset from the ASL dataset for our ‘open_hand’ class, and images labelled ‘A’ and ‘S’ for our ‘closed_hand’ class. We also supplemented our data with additional images from the Hands Images dataset, which better capture the specific thumb positions we needed and include hands wearing gloves.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have 2 labels, ‘open_hand’ and ‘closed_hand’. Since this is a supervised classification task, the folder structure itself serves as a label; images in the ‘open_hand’ folder belong to ‘open_hand’ class, and the same labelling rule applies for those in the ‘closed_hand’ folder.\n",
        "\n",
